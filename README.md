# 🌱 Plants vs. Zombies (C++ & SFML)

A fan-made recreation of the classic **Plants vs. Zombies** game, built from scratch in **C++20** using the **SFML graphics library**.  
This project was developed as part of my academic and personal exploration into **game development, object-oriented programming, and graphics rendering**.

![Plants vs Zombies – C++ & SFML](./files/README.jpg)


## 🎮 Features
- Classic **tower-defense gameplay**: defend your lawn against waves of zombies.
- Implemented core mechanics:
  - 🌻 **Sunflowers** generate sun (currency).  
  - 🌱 **Peashooters & Snow Peas** attack zombies.  
  - 🧱 **Wall-nuts** block zombie progress.  
  - 💀 Multiple zombie types with different behaviors.
- **Grid-based lawn system** with lane-based strategy.
- **Smooth animations and sound effects** powered by SFML.
- Modular, object-oriented design for easy extension.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++20  
- **Graphics & Audio:** [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)  
- **Build System:** Makefile  
- **OS Compatibility:** Linux (tested), should work on Windows/macOS with SFML installed  


## 🚀 Getting Started
### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mragetsars/Plants-VS-Zombies.git
cd Plants-VS-Zombies
```
### 2. Install dependencies
Make sure you have **SFML** installed on your system. For example, on Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```
### 3. Build and Run the game
```bash
make clean #Clean build files
make
./pvz.out
```

## 📖 Future Improvements
- Add more plant and zombie types (Cherry Bomb, Potato Mine, Conehead Zombie, etc.)
- Implement level progression and menus.
- Improve animations and sound design.
- Cross-platform build instructions (Windows/macOS).
